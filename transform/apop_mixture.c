\amodel apop_mixture The mixture model transformation: a linear combination of multiple models.  

Use \ref apop_model_mixture to produce one of these models. In the examples below, some are generated from unparameterized input models with a form like 

\code
apop_model *mf = apop_model_mixture(apop_model_copy(apop_normal), apop_model_copy(apop_normal));
Apop_settings_set(mf, apop_mixture, find_weights, 'y');
Apop_model_add_group(mf, apop_mle, .starting_pt=(double[]){.5, .5, 50, 5, 80, 5},
                                   .step_size=3, .tolerance=1e-6);
apop_model_show(apop_estimate(dd, mf));
\endcode

Or, one can skip the estimation and use already-parameterized models as input to \ref apop_model_mixture, e.g.:

\code
apop_model *r_ed = apop_model_mixture(apop_model_set_parameters(apop_normal, 54.6, 5.87),
                       apop_model_set_parameters(apop_normal, 80.1, 5.87));
apop_data *wts = apop_data_falloc((2), 0.36, 0.64);
Apop_settings_add(r_ed, apop_mixture, weights, wts->vector);
printf("LL=%g\n", apop_log_likelihood(dd, r_ed));
\endcode

Notice that the weights vector has to be added after the call to \ref apop_model_mixture. If none is given, then equal weights are assigned to all components of the mixture.

One can think of the estimation in the un-parameterized case as a missing-data problem: each data point originated
in one distribution or the other, and if we knew with certainty which data point
came from which distribution, then the estimation problem would be trivial:
just generate the subsets and call <tt>apop_estimate(dataset1, model1)</tt>, ...,
<tt>apop_estimate(datasetn, modeln)</tt> separately.  But the assignment of which
element goes where is unknown information, which we guess at using an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The
standard algorithm starts with an initial set of parameters for the models, and assigns
each data point to its most likely model. It then re-estimates the
model parameters using their subsets. The standard algorithm, see e.g. <a
href="http://www.jstatsoft.org/v32/i06/paper">this PDF</a>, repeats until it arrives
at an optimum.

Thus, the log likelihood method for this model includes a step that allocates each data
point to its most likely model, and calculates the log likelihood of each observation
using its most likely model. [It would be a valuable extension to extend this to
not-conditionally IID models. Commit \c 1ac0dd44 in the repository had some notes on
this, now removed.]  As a side-effect, it calculates the odds of drawing from each model
(the vector Î»). Following the above-linked paper, the probability for a given
observation under the mixture model is its probability under the most likely model
weighted by the previously calculated \f$\lambda\f$ for the given model.

Apophenia implements the EM algorithm as a constrained optimization(!). The constraint
check repositions the vector of weights to that calculated at the last step, then the
log likelihood calculates the likelihood as above, including the expected value of
the weights vector for the next step. Thus, Apophenia casts the Expectation step as
a step repositioning the maximization's constraint and its associated penalties.

<em>Estimations of mixture distributions can be sensitive to initial conditions.</em>
You are encouraged to try a sequence of random starting points for your model parameters.
Some authors recommend plotting the data and eyeballing a guess as to the model parameters.

\li The default is to take the weight assigned to each distribution as fixed. If you
want to use the EM algorithm to move the weights as described above, specify this via
\code
Apop_settings_set(your_model, apop_mixture, find_weights, 'y');
\endcode

\li A kernel density is a mixture of a large number of homogeneous models, where each is typically centered around a point in your data. For such situations, \ref apop_kernel_density will be easier to use.

\adoc    Input_format   The same data gets sent to each of the component models of the
mixture. Each row is an observation, and the estimation routine assumes that models are
conditionally IID (i.e., having chosen what component of the mixture the observation
comes from, its likelihood can be calculated independently of all other observations).

\adoc    Settings   \ref apop_mixture_settings 

\adoc    Parameter_format The parameters are broken out in a readable form in the
    settings group, so your best bet is to use those. See the sample code for usage.<br>
    The <tt>parameter</tt> element is a single vector piling up all elements, beginning
    with the first \f$n-1\f$ weights, followed by an <tt>apop_data_pack</tt> of each model's
    parameters in sequence. Because all elements are in a single vector, one could run a
    maximum likelihood search for all components (including the weights) at once. 
    The <tt>log_likehood</tt>, <tt>estimate</tt>, and other methods unpack
    this vector into its component parts for you.

\adoc RNG Uses the weights to select a component model, then makes a draw from that component.
The model's \c dsize (draw size) element is set when you set up the model in the
model's \c prep method (automatically called by \ref apop_estimate, or call it directly)
iff all component models have the same \c dsize.

\adoc   Examples
The first example uses a text file \c faith.data, in the \c tests directory of the distribution.
\include faithful.c

This example begins with a fixed mixture distribution, and makes assertions about the characteristics of draws from it.
